                                <span class="timeline-date">2020</span>
                                <p>Initially, I had little idea about the world of coding. It wasn't something I had
                                    planned or imagined myself doing. However, a friend introduced me to the field and
                                    encouraged me to explore it. Out of curiosity, I decided to give it a try ‚Äî and it
                                    turned out to be a life-changing decision. As I started learning the basics, I found
                                    myself genuinely enjoying the logic, creativity, and problem-solving involved. That
                                    first step, inspired by a friend's suggestion, marked the beginning of my journey
                                    into the exciting world of technology and programming.</p>

                                <h3>Starting My College and Course Path üéì</h3>
                                <span class="timeline-date">2020</span>
                                <p>After chose Coding career, I decided to pursue higher studies in the field of
                                    technology. I enrolled in the Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) program at Srinivasa
                                    Ramanujan Institute of Technology from Andhra Pradesh. Choosing B.Tech was a turning
                                    point for me, as it provided a strong foundation in Electronics, computer science,
                                    programming and software development. Throughout my college journey, I gained not
                                    only academic knowledge but also developed skills, discipline and a deeper passion
                                    for the world of technology.</p>

                                <h3>My Coding Journey üíª</h3>
                                <span class="timeline-date">2022 - Present</span>
                                <p>I began my coding journey during college with JavaScript, which helped me build a
                                    solid understanding of programming fundamentals and Data Structures & Algorithms
                                    (DSA). Through consistent practice, I developed strong problem-solving skills that
                                    laid the foundation for my technical growth. Later, I discovered a strong interest
                                    in Frontend Development and started learning HTML and CSS. I focused on building
                                    responsive and interactive web pages, bringing ideas to life through projects like
                                    login forms, personal portfolios, calculators, and a Ludo game. These practical
                                    experiences not only improved my frontend skills but also sparked a deeper passion
                                    for creating engaging and user-friendly digital experiences. I also use <strong><a

                                <span class="timeline-date">2024 - Present</span>
                                <p>As I continued my journey in web development, I took the next step by learning
                                    JavaScript to enhance the interactivity and functionality of my websites. This
                                    allowed me to build fully responsive and dynamic projects. With a growing passion
                                    for development, I'm currently expanding my skill set by learning the React library
                                    for building scalable user interfaces, and working with modern styling frameworks
                                    like Bootstrap and Tailwind CSS. On the backend side, I've started working with
                                    MySQL to understand database integration. My ultimate goal is to become a proficient
                                    Full Stack Developer, capable of building complete web applications from front to
                                    back. I posted my all completed projects and websites in <a href=""

                    <p>Hi there, I‚Äôm Masood Vali Appecherla. I'm a passionate Frontend Developer üë®‚Äçüíª. I enjoy building
                        websites with Responsive Web Design ‚Äî it makes me feel creative üöÄ.</p>
                    <p>I have frontend skills in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (ES6+), along with libraries and frameworks
                        like React, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS. I‚Äôve built several projects using this tech stack. I
                        also use AI to create websites because, in this generation, having AI skills is essential for a
                        better future in development. <br> I‚Äôm currently learning databases like MySQL, and after
                        completing that, I‚Äôll move on to backend tools like Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB to secure my
                        future in full stack development.
                        Once I complete both frontend and backend, I‚Äôll transition from being a Frontend Developer to a
                        Full Stack Developer üë®‚Äçüíª, because full stack roles are more valuable and offer higher-paying
                        opportunities than frontend roles alone.</p>
                    <p>Beyond coding, I'm passionate about creating digital experiences that are both beautiful and
                        functional. I believe in the power of clean code and thoughtful design to transform ideas into
                        reality.</p>
                    <p>When I'm not in front of my Laptop, you can find me exploring new technologies, reading tech
                        blogs or contributing to the developer community. I'm always eager to learn and take on new
                        challenges that push me outside my comfort zone. I read Tech related articles and post my
                        written articles and blogs on <strong>Dev Community</strong> and <strong>Daily.dev</strong>.</p>
                    <p>My goal is to continue growing as a developer and designer, creating meaningful projects that
                        make a positive impact on users' lives. I create several websites and projects after that I post
                        them <strong>GitHub</strong>, <strong>Vercel</strong>, <strong>LinkedIn</strong> and
                        <strong>X</strong> because I think these social icons are very helpful to show your skills to
                        someone and find the work employees who can see your skills or experience and then they can give
                        you an opportunity to work in the company.</p>
